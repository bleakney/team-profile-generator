  ## Description

  This project was to build a team profile generator using node.js and inquirer to dynamically generate a webpage displaying professional profiles and contact information for all members of the user's team.

  ## Installation

  Simply run "npm install", followed by "npm install inquirer".

  ## Usage

  Once you have installed the project, make sure you are in the root directory, then type "node index.js" into the command line and answer the questions as you are prompted!


  ## Testing

  I installed jest using npm to run tests on all constructor classes. If you would like to try running the tests included in the __tests__ folder, simply run "npm install jest" in the root directory for the project, then enter "npm run test" once it has installed.
